# New Relic Puppet module

`newrelic-newrelic_installer` is a [Puppet module](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/newrelic/newrelic_installer/readme) that will help you scale your New Relic Observability efforts. It uses the [New Relic CLI](https://github.com/newrelic/newrelic-cli) and [New Relic Open Installation repository](https://github.com/newrelic/open-install-library) to achieve this.

Currently, we have included Linux and Windows support for New Relic's Infrastructure and Logs integrations, with more agents and integrations following in the near future.

**Note: Installing specific versions of an agent is not supported, this role will always install latest released version of a New Relic agent.**

          targets               => ["infrastructure", "logs", "php"],
          environment_variables => {
            "NEW_RELIC_API_KEY"          => "<YOUR-NR-API-KEY>",
            "NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID"       => <YOUR-NR-ACCOUNT-ID>,
            "NEW_RELIC_REGION"           => "<US|EU>",
